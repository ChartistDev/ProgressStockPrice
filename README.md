# ProgressStockPrice
A small Project to display Stock price data

Note : This is a P.U.D . Latest daily data of three hardcoded securities are fetched and filtered accoring to from and to dates.
I have not used any Javascript framework in creating the application. Only d3.js is used as a charting library
